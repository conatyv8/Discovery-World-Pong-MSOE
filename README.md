# Discovery World Pong
This repository contains the code behind the Rockwell Automation "Pong" exhibit at the Discovery World Museum in Milwaukee, WI

An overview of this repo's history and goals can be found in the [vision.md](/docs/API/overview/vision.md) document.

# Development
## Dependencies
Docker (and Docker Compose) are required to build the containers.
Other OCI compliant runtimes like Podman should work.
To run the exhibit, an Intel Realsense 435 camera and drivers is required.
See [post-install.sh](setup/post-install.sh) for a full exhibit setup script from a vanilla Ubuntu install.

## Build
To build all the containers, run the following:
```
docker compose build
```

### Start/stop the exhibit using docker-compose
To start the containers using docker-compose run the following:
```
docker compose up -d
```
To stop the containers using docker-compose run the following:
```
docker compose down
```

To open each GUI window in their positions used in the exhibit, run the following:
```
./setup/open_windows.sh
```
Keep in mind that unless the machine has its monitors configured similarly to the exhibit, the behavior is undefined.
To manually open the windows, open an internet browser to the following sites:
#### Gameboard
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
#### Human Visualizer (Depth Camera Heatmap)
[http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)
##### Neural Network Visualizer
[http://localhost:5002](http://localhost:5002)
##### Clocktower Visualizer
[http://localhost:5003](http://localhost:5003)

To close all GUI windows, run the following
```
./setup/close_windows.sh
```
